            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML,CSS and Javascript. I can build any simple website. My goal is to build
                websites
                and learn advanced topics. I love travelling. If someone asks me about my life goals, I always say I
                wanna see the world around. I find peace,
                happiness and adventures in travelling. And it is the an essential part of my life. Also, I want to
                visit all the famous
                football stadiums specially Santiago Bernabéu, that's my bucket list.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't
                    stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know
                    the
                    deployment,
                    server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
